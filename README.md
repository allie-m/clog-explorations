This repo contains my continued logarithm explorations, done for my W25 1L and S25 130E classes.

(130E) See clog-pyrtl/ for my pyrtl implementation of redundant continued logarithms (w/some significant deviations from Brabec).

(1L) See clog-calculator/ for the calculator and its associated build instructions. See clog-testing/ for the python scripts I used to explore continued logarithms and make the graphics for the writeup. See https://allielmno.com/blogposts/clogs-w25.html for the writeup.

See papers/ for all the extant continued logarithm resources/literature.
