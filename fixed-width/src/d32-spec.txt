WAIT IDEA
1 bit (- or no)
1 bit (/ or no)
7 bit exponand (0-127 1s to follow)
(implicit 0)
23 bit mantissa (1s and 0s, trailing zeros ignored, implicit 0oo following)
^ hmmmm no i don't think spanning orders of magnitude like this is gonna work well
if you really need to span that many orders of magnitude you're not gonna be able to do precise computation
which is what this is all about
ok is there a way to make (b/n)lfts compatible with spanning orders of magnitude?
omit the # of 1s they have in common in their exponand?
