Inspired by a [lobsters post](https://lobste.rs/s/xjrlj2/how_android_s_calculator_works_with_real), this is a CLI calculator implemented with a speculatively redundant continued logarithm scheme, as described in [Brabec 2010](TODO).

An easier way to do real arithmetic than RRA or computer algebra.
